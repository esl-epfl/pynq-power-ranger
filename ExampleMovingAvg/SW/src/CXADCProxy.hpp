// This class imlements functionality to access the XADC device of the Pynq Power Ranger.
// The user has to call StartMeasurements(). Then, GetPower() can be used to retrieve a 
// monotonically increasing value of energy consumed since the call to StartMeasurements().
// The values are given in Joules and can be subtracted.
//
// The class creates a secondary thread using pthreads that polls the ADC.
// The ADC acquires 256 samples and averages them to deliver one sample at ~123 Hz.
// The worker thread waits 8130 us between sample readings (polling), which roughly matches the 
// sample production rate of the ADC.
//
// The worker thread is stopped when StopMeasurements() is called. The user cannot read power
// values if the thread is not active.
//
// Calling GetPower() once StartMeasurements() has been called IS NOT THREAD-SAFE and can lead
// to the ADC HW crashing! Use GetEnergy with a valid argument instead.
