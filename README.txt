This folder contains two use examples for the Pynq Power Ranger, used with the Pynq Z2 board (TUL).

The Pynq Power Ranger is connected to the processors thru the AXI4 bus. To simplify integration in other projects, a file "recreate_xadc.tcl" is provided to include and configure the XADC module in a block diagram in Vivado.

All the examples are for execution with Vitis HLS and Vivado 2022.2.

The examples include also the SW necessary to create a C/C++ application in Linux, inside the Pynq board. The SW examples are meant to be compiled inside the Pynq board!

The HW projects include a Makefile with multiple targets through the Vitis HLS to Vivado and, finally, bitstream generation. Use 'make help' to display the list of available targets.

The bitstreams can be programmed directly from the Pynq board itself using the provided 'programOverlay.py' script. The script requires the '.bit' and '.hwh' files generated by Vivado. It's possible to generate the corresponding '.bin' files using bootgen to program the FPGA directly using the fpga_manager module.
